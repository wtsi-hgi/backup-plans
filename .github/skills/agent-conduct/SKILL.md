# Agent Conduct Skill

These rules apply to ALL agents and skills in this project. Every
skill document references this one. Follow every rule below
regardless of which skill you are operating under.

## Workspace Boundary (Mandatory)

### Hard boundary: write only inside the repository

- NEVER create, edit, or delete files outside the repository
  directory.
- NEVER write to `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, `/dev/null`,
  home-directory temp paths, or any absolute path outside the repo.
- If a command would write outside the repo, do not run it. Rewrite
  it so all outputs stay under the repo.

### Pre-write check

Before any file-writing command, confirm the target path is inside
the current repository root. If not, stop and choose an in-repo
alternative.

## Scratch Work

### Preferred alternatives

- For runtime temporary data in tests, use `t.TempDir()` (Go) or
  the language-appropriate equivalent.
- For quick one-off shell logic, prefer inline pipelines or
  heredocs instead of writing helper scripts.
- If a temporary file is truly needed, create it under
  `.tmp/agent/` in the repo (create the directory if needed) and
  clean it up before finishing.

### Avoid tooling confusion from ad-hoc files

- Do NOT create standalone helper `.go` files in the repo root,
  `.tmp/`, or other non-package locations. The Go toolchain treats
  any `.go` file in a directory as part of a package and ad-hoc
  files cause build failures.
- Do NOT use throwaway Go scripts as scratch helpers.
- If temporary helper logic is required, prefer shell
  scripts/text files in `.tmp/agent/` (non-`.go`), or place
  test-only helpers inside the relevant package test files.

## Terminal Safety

### Avoid VS Code confirmation prompts

VS Code intercepts certain terminal operations and shows a modal
confirmation dialog that blocks automated workflows. Avoid
triggering these:

- Do NOT run interactive commands that expect user input (e.g.
  `ssh`, `mysql` shells, `less`, `vi`). Use non-interactive
  equivalents or flags (e.g. `git --no-pager`, `less -F`).
- Do NOT run commands that create processes listening on ports
  without using background mode.
- Do NOT use `sudo` or other privilege-escalation commands.
- Do NOT run `rm -rf` on broad paths. For file removal within
  the repo, be specific and targeted, or move files to a
  `.trash/` directory within the repo instead of deleting.
- Prefer `command | cat` over pager-based output to avoid
  terminal paging prompts.
- Use `set -e` in multi-step shell commands so failures surface
  immediately rather than silently continuing.

### Command hygiene

- Quote shell variables: `"$var"` instead of `$var`.
- Use `[[ ]]` for conditional tests instead of `[ ]`.
- Prefer `$()` over backticks for command substitution.
- Limit output size: use `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `wc -l`
  before displaying potentially large outputs.

## Git Safety

- Do NOT push to the remote - never run `git push`.
- Do NOT force-push, rebase published branches, or rewrite
  remote history.
- Do NOT modify `.git/` internals directly.
- Prefer targeted `git add <file>` over `git add .` to avoid
  committing unintended files.

## General Rules

- Do NOT install system packages or modify the system environment.
- Do NOT modify files outside the scope of the current task.
- Keep changes minimal and targeted. Do not refactor unrelated code
  unless explicitly asked to.
- When in doubt about whether an action is safe, choose the more
  conservative option.
