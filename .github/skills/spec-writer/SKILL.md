# Spec Writer Skill

You are an orchestrating agent. You do NOT write specs or review them
yourself - you launch subagents (via `runSubagent`) to do that work,
embedding the relevant skill instructions in each subagent's prompt.
This keeps your context clean and focused on coordination.

Note: `spec-author`, `spec-reviewer`, `spec-proofreader`,
`phase-creator`, and `phase-reviewer` are skills (instruction files
in `.github/skills/`), not named agents. To use them, read their
SKILL.md and include the full text in the `runSubagent` prompt.

## Input

The caller provides:

- **Feature description** - what the feature should do.
- **Output path** - where to write the spec (e.g.
  `.docs/myfeature/spec.md`).
- Any additional context, constraints, or references.

## Procedure

### 1. Clarify requirements

Before launching any subagents, ask the caller clarifying questions
to resolve ambiguity. Use the `ask_questions` tool to batch up to 4
questions. Focus on:

- **Scope boundaries:** What is in scope vs out of scope? Are there
  existing packages or functions to reuse vs new ones to create?
- **External dependencies:** Does the feature interact with external
  systems (databases, APIs, file systems, network services)? How
  should these be mocked/abstracted for testing?
- **Error handling:** What should happen on invalid input, missing
  files, network failures, etc.?
- **Performance/scale:** Are there memory or performance constraints?
  Should streaming patterns be used? What scale of data is expected?
- **Configuration:** What is user-configurable vs hardcoded? What are
  sensible defaults?
- **Integration points:** How does this feature connect to existing
  code? Which existing types, interfaces, or packages should be used?

Do NOT ask questions whose answers are obvious from the feature
description or can be reasonably inferred. Only ask when the caller's
answer would meaningfully change the spec.

After receiving answers, proceed. Do not ask further rounds of
questions unless answers reveal a fundamental ambiguity.

### 2. Read skill files

Read the following skill files so you can include their full text in
subagent prompts:

- `.github/skills/spec-author/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/spec-reviewer/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/spec-proofreader/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/phase-creator/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/phase-reviewer/SKILL.md`

### 3. Initial spec authoring

Launch a subagent with the **spec-author** skill by including in its
prompt:

- The full text of the spec-author skill.
- The feature description (including all clarifying Q&A).
- The output path.
- The instruction: "You have clean context. Research the codebase,
  then write the spec to the output path. Follow the spec-author
  skill instructions exactly."

### 4. Feature coverage review cycle

Launch a subagent with the **spec-reviewer** skill by including in
its prompt:

- The full text of the spec-reviewer skill.
- The feature description (including all clarifying Q&A).
- The spec path.
- The instruction: "You have clean context. Read the spec and the
  feature description. Return PASS or FAIL with specific feedback
  on whether the spec fully covers the requested feature."

**On PASS:** Record a consecutive pass count. If this is the 2nd
consecutive PASS, move to step 5. Otherwise, repeat this step with
a fresh subagent.

**On FAIL:** Reset the consecutive pass count to 0. Launch a new
spec-author subagent with the reviewer's feedback included in the
prompt:

- The full text of the spec-author skill.
- The feature description.
- The output path.
- The reviewer's specific feedback.
- The instruction: "You have clean context. Read the existing spec,
  then revise it to address the reviewer's feedback. Do not
  introduce unrelated changes."

Then repeat this step (launch a fresh spec-reviewer subagent).

### 5. Text quality proofreading cycle

Launch a subagent with the **spec-proofreader** skill by including
in its prompt:

- The full text of the spec-proofreader skill.
- The spec path.
- The instruction: "You have clean context. Read the spec and review
  it for text quality issues. Fix any errors you find directly in
  the document. Return PASS if no changes were needed, or FIXED
  with a list of what you changed."
- Do NOT include the feature description - the proofreader must
  work without it.

**On PASS:** Record a consecutive pass count. If this is the 2nd
consecutive PASS, move to step 6. Otherwise, repeat this step with
a fresh spec-proofreader subagent.

**On FIXED:** Reset the consecutive pass count to 0. Repeat this
step with a fresh spec-proofreader subagent.

### 6. Phase document creation

Launch a subagent with the **phase-creator** skill by including in
its prompt:

- The full text of the phase-creator skill.
- The spec path.
- The output directory (same directory as the spec).
- The instruction: "You have clean context. Read the spec's
  Implementation Order and create one phase file per phase.
  Follow the phase-creator skill instructions exactly."

### 7. Phase document review

For each phase file created, launch a subagent with the
**phase-reviewer** skill by including in its prompt:

- The full text of the phase-reviewer skill.
- The phase file path.
- The spec path.
- The instruction: "You have clean context. Read the phase file
  and the spec. Verify story references, check for text quality
  issues, and fix any errors. Return PASS if no changes were
  needed, or FIXED with a list of what you changed."

**On PASS:** Move to the next phase file, or finish if all phase
files have been reviewed.

**On FIXED:** Repeat the review for that same phase file with a
fresh subagent. Continue until it returns PASS.

Once all phase files have passed review, report completion to the
caller.

## Error Handling

- **Transient subagent failures** (e.g. "try again" errors): Wait a
  few seconds, then retry with a new subagent. Include in the new
  subagent's prompt what the previous subagent had already achieved,
  so work is not repeated.
- **Never write outside the repository directory.**

## Rules

- Do NOT write specs directly - always use spec-author subagents.
- Do NOT review specs directly - always use spec-reviewer or
  spec-proofreader subagents.
- Do NOT pass the feature description to the spec-proofreader.
- Do NOT skip review cycles. Both the feature coverage review and
  the text quality proofreading must reach 2 consecutive passes.
  Phase reviews must each reach 1 clean pass.
- Do NOT create phase files directly - use the phase-creator
  subagent.
- Keep your context minimal: delegate, track, coordinate.
